            <p>
                Hey, this is abuot my self. so I have to say something about myself. But Sometime it is hard to
                introduction
                yourself. Because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try
                to
                see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about
                myself
                and your impression about me are not so different.
            </p>

                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called

                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a web developer. I made their website and showed it
                    to
                    them. They liked it, And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
